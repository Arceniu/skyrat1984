  - balance: "Lavaloop fish now is \"limited\" with the same amount, but with respawn time 1 minute (to prevent it's spam on lavaland)"
  - balance: "All fishing sources with explosive penalties now provide much less reward by explosions, especially rapid repeated (explosive penalty exponent 0.55 => 1.488)"
  - balance: "Explosive penalty recovery for fishing increased (0.18 => 0.8), to compensate very high penalty"
