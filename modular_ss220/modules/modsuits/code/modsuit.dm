This MODsuit represents an ambitious, albeit unofficial, attempt to create a cost-effective advanced armor solution.  Based on a standard Apadyne Technologies security chassis, the suit has undergone significant modifications with the goal of maximizing protection through the use of surplus and experimental materials.  \
		While successful in increasing resistance to ballistic, explosive and energy attacks, these modifications have resulted in a noticeable increase in weight, hindering the wearer's mobility. \
		The improvised upgraded thermal shielding offers user good protection against flame, however, prolonged exposure will melt the suit, potentially resulting in burns for the wearer.  \
		Furthermore, due to the non-standard design and internal rewiring, this MODsuit is incompatible with armor enhancement modules. \
		The internal systems, while functional, are a patchwork of repurposed components, potentially impacting module compatibility and overall system reliability. This MODsuit is a testament to ingenuity and resourcefulness, offering enhanced protection at a compromise, but at a cost."
