		While successful in increasing resistance to ballistic, explosive and energy attacks, these modifications have resulted in a noticeable increase in weight, hindering the wearer's mobility. \
		The improvised upgraded thermal shielding offers user good protection against flame, however, prolonged exposure will melt the suit, potentially resulting in burns for the wearer.  \
		Furthermore, due to the non-standard design and internal rewiring, this MODsuit is incompatible with armor enhancement modules. \
