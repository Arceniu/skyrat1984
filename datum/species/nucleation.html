You need to manually delete &quot;cache&quot; folder (at root of repository, where .dmb and all that stuff are stored)
Most likely it tied to smart caching, that COULD be enabled locally, in case you use config_server (which have it enabled)
Once that done, it should correctly invoke this
If you see troubles on server, but not locally: then you probably need to notify host about it
